	abstract = {A numerical optimization technique has been developed to determine the optimum propeller blade shape for efficiency improvement. The method satisfies the constraints of the constant power coefficient and the activity factor. A lifting line theory (vortex lattice method) and a lifting surface theory (3-D panel method) are used to calculate aerodynamic performance parameters of propellers. Both lifting theories use rigid helical wake models. The design variables are twist angle and chord length at mid points of vortex lattices for vortex lattice method and nodes of panels for the 3-D panel method. The optimization code is validated by comparing the results with other numerical schemes. Twist angle and chord length distributions are optimized for various propellers. SR-3 and SR-7 propfan blade shapes are also optimized using the 3-D panel method for aerodynamic load calculation.},
