	abstract = {This article summarizes recent developments and applications of digital photogrammetry in industrial measurement. Industrial photogrammetry covers a wide field of different practical challenges in terms of specified accuracy, measurement speed, automation, process integration, cost-performance ratio, sensor integration and analysis. On-line and off-line systems are available, offering general purpose systems on the one hand and specific turnkey systems for individual measurement tasks on the other. Verification of accuracy and traceability to standard units with respect to national and international standards is inevitable in industrial practice. System solutions can be divided into the measurement of discrete points, deformations and motions, 6DOF parameters, 3D contours and 3D surfaces. Recent and future developments concentrate on higher dynamic applications, integration of systems into production chains, multi-sensor solutions and still higher accuracy and lower costs.},
