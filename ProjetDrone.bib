Throughout the paper, various types of the related techniques are reviewed, which consist, mainly, of close-range, aerial, structure-from-motion and terrestrial photogrammetry, and mobile, terrestrial and airborne laser scanning, as well as time-of-flight, structured-light and phase-comparison methods, along with comparative and combinational studies, the latter being intended to help make a clearer distinction on the relevance and reliability of the possible choices. Moreover, outlier detection and surface fitting procedures are discussed concisely, which are necessary post-processing stages.},

	abstract = {In the process of airfoil optimization, it is required to represent an airfoil with parameters, and the goal is to represent arbitrary airfoils with less parameters. In this paper, a new airfoil parameterization method is proposed, called the IGP method, which realized camber-thickness decoupling so that camber and thickness could be constructed respectively with fewer parameters compared to the previous methods. Also the IGP method is featured with clear physical meaning and consecution of parameter domain. The mathematical model is introduced. With this camber-thickness decoupling method, the definition and the domain of the control parameters was determined. To validate the feasibility, the most used airfoils were fitted and reconstructed by this method. Then according to the results of geometric and aerodynamic comparative analysis between original airfoils and fitted airfoils, the precision of the IGP method could meet the requirement of airfoil optimization.},

	abstract = {In aeronautics and shipbuilding fields quality control of propellers is an obligatory step, a hard task up to some years ago: the shape of each blade has to be measured with high accuracy and referred to a global frame. Specific CMMs were used in the past to perform such complex analyses. When propellers were mounted on ships on dry dock, inspections became nearly impossible to be performed. In this work, both photogrammetric and laser scanning low cost methodologies for 3D reverse modelling of complex objects with high level of detail are proposed. Three photogrammetric software for both commercial and research uses, have been tested in this study for generating high density point clouds. The feasibility of using a low cost triangulation scanner for high accuracy purposes has been studied in the case of small screw propellers. The problem of bringing together all the measurements in a single reference frame with high accuracy is solved by means of colour information. The study shows that a hybrid approach that integrates both photogrammetry and laser scanning methods is necessary. Screws of different sizes, surveyed in laboratory and on the field, such as in dry docks, are modelled and inspected. Different procedures for determining geometrical parameters are shown. Geometrical characteristics derived by 3D models of screws, are compared both with those expected by original plans and CMM measurements. 1.},

The errors depend on the frequency of the projected patterns, and the nature of indirect illumination. In particular, we show that long-range eﬀects cause decoding errors for low-frequency patterns, whereas shortrange eﬀects aﬀect high-frequency patterns.},

	abstract = {The effect of airfoil shape parameterization on optimum design and its inﬂuence on the convergence of the optimization process are investigated. A new method for airfoil shape parameterization is presented which takes into consideration the characteristics of viscous transonic ﬂow particularly around the trailing edge. The method is then applied to airfoil shape optimization at high Reynolds number turbulent ﬂow conditions using a Genetic Algorithm. An unstructured grid Navier–Stokes ﬂow solver with a two-equation K−ε turbulence model is used to evaluate the ﬁtness function. The aerodynamic characteristics of the optimum airfoil obtained from the proposed parametric method are compared with those from alternative methods. It is concluded that the new method is capable of ﬁnding efﬁcient and optimum airfoils in fewer number of generations. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The numerical search for the optimum shape of an aerofoil is of great interest for aircraft and turbomachine designers. Unfortunately, this process is very computationally intense and can require a large number of individual flow field simulations resulting in very long CPU run times. One of the core issues that the designer must deal with is how to describe the shape of the airfoil. Clearly, we cannot treat the profile on a point by point basis as the problem would have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Hence the typical practice is to resort to using a series of curves, such as polynomials and Bezier curves, to describe the profile. This typically reduces the number of degrees of freedom to a much smaller, manageable number. The influence of the selection of the parameterization on the optimization has received relatively little consideration to date. We can anticipate that some parameterizations will be less suitable for describing the profile shape and may result in slower convergence times. Our paper will discuss a new airfoil parameterization, Bezier-PARSEC, that was developed to extend and improve the typical Bezier parameterization found in use. This parameterization was found to fit the known shape of a wide range of existing airfoil profiles as well as resulting in accelerated convergence for aerodynamic optimization using Differential Evolution. Our presentation will present the development and details of the Bezier-PARSEC parameterization and provide evidence that the parameterization is suitable and accelerates convergence.},
