	abstract = {All instruments collecting 3D coordinates of a given region of an object surface automatically and in a systematic pattern at high rates and achieving these results in near real time are considered as 3D scanning instruments in this article. For cultural heritage documentation, mobile systems for close- and mid-range applications are applicable. Different technical solutions have been developed to obtain the necessary measurements for the derivation of the 3D point coordinates on a reflecting surface. Ranging scanners measure horizontal and vertical angles and compute the distance either by the time-of-flight method or by comparing the phases of the transmitted and received wave form of a modulated signal. Triangulation type instruments include a base. They analyze the location of a projected laser spot or other pattern using one or two CCD cameras. The different principles lead to a different accuracy behavior of the distance measurement. Since noisy measurements are difficult to process, a high accuracy of the scanner is desirable. This leads to the conclusion that no single scanner can fulfil all demands in different cultural heritage recording projects.},
